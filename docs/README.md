# Various To-Do's and such for the Meetup

## Month/Weeks before Meetup

- Identify topic/speaker(s)
  - Prefer to do 1 vendor + 1 local community member/user story
  - Update Schedule spreadsheet (Google Docs)
- Get Zoom Webinar setup (currently through Alex and Salesloft)
- Setup Meetup Event
  - Copy exiting Meetup and edit for new Meetup as appropriate
  - All Virtual for now....specific spot in Meetup fields to put Zoom link (this is good to prevent non-auth'd accounts and Zoom Spam)

## Day Before Meetup

- Create short link in rebrandly for meetup notes
- Advertise Meetup
  - Tweet about it from your personal account & @k8satl account
  - Post tweets on tech404 slack #meetups and #kubernetes channels
- Send out email to speaker(s) to confirm day/time/attendance for meetup

## After Meetup

- Upload recording to Youtube
- Update video shortlink in rebrandly to point at new video
- Create new meetup specific video link in rebrandly
- Collect slide deck/artifacts from speaker and post to slideshare or in repo if necessary (try to avoid large artifacts in repo if possible)
  - Update any links in docs for speaker slides/notes/artifactcs
- Post links for slides/video in appropriate places (need to balance usefulness vs. spamminess)
  - Maybe on twitter from k8satl account
  - Maybe in Meetup comments
  - Maybe in tech404 Slack #kubernetes channel
