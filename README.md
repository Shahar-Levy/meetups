Welcome to our little slice of GutHub!

This is where we keep track of the ongoings of the [Kubernetes Atlanta Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Kubernetes-Atlanta-Meetup).

## Suggestion for Topics

Please open an issue if you have a sggestion for a topic you'd like to see at one of out meetups. We will rely on thumbs up votes on the issue to rank interest, so campaign for votes if needed!

## Interested in Speaking

Please reach out to `k8satl <at> gmail <dot> com` if you are interested in speaking at a meetup. 

We have a few requirements:

- Needs to be releated to the Cloud Native/CNCF lanscape and centered around Open Source
- No vendor pitches/sales type content
- If you are a vendor, it always helps to partner with a commnity member to do a user-story with you
- Typically alloted 45-90 minutes, but we also host lightning talks (10min or less) from time to time
