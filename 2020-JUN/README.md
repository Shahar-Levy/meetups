## This Month in Kubernetes

- There is an interesting effort to implement non-standard kubelets put forward by a consortium at (https://github.com/virtual-kubelet)
	The idea seems to be around running pods as things like fargate instances, but one new project, elotl, actually launches right-sized
	ec2 instances on a per-pod level, based on the pod memory/instance request: https://github.com/elotl/kip
